Tiny but mighty, Coco the Chihuahua ruled the household with his boundless energy, always dashing ahead on adventures with his sister, Devlyn. While Paco was fearless—barking at birds twice his size—Devlyn was the cautious one, always watching out for her brother’s reckless antics. Despite their differences, they were inseparable, curled up together like yin and yang at the end of every day. Whether playfully tugging at the same toy or racing each other across the yard, their bond was unbreakable—a testament to the power of sibling love, even in the smallest of creatures.
